      terms
      carefully as well.

      <p>This Privacy Policy outlines the types of data we collect from your interaction with YouVersion, as well as how

      <p>We take the privacy of the information you provide and that we collect seriously and we implement security
        safeguards

          Information we Collect and How we collect it
        </h2>
      </header>
      The information we collect depends on the services and functionality you request. You may decline to submit
      personal
      information to us; however, that may prohibit us from having the ability to provide you with certain services or
      functionality. The personal information we collect and the purpose for which we use that information are described
      below.
      <h5>
        Personal information you provide to us.

      </h5>
      <p>
        You do not need to sign up for a Membership account to use YouVersion. However, Membership allows us to tailor
        YouVersion to be a more personalized experience. To create a YouVersion Membership account, we require that you
        provide
        a first name, last name, and a valid email address. We will use this information to associate you with your
        specific
        YouVersion Member account. After you have created a YouVersion Member account, you may also choose to provide
        your
        gender, age, website, description of your location, a brief biography, a profile picture, and other information
        such
        as
        User Contributions (defined below). All of these, if provided, will be associated with your account until you
        delete
        your account or make a request that the information be deleted as described below.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond the personal information collected to create a Member account, you have choices about what additional
        information
        you provide to us. We collect personal data from you when you provide, post, or upload it to YouVersion. You do
        not have
        to provide this information; however, if you do not, it may limit our ability to personalize YouVersion and your
        ability
        to use YouVersion to its fullest extent. Specific YouVersion functionality for which you may provide and we may
        process
        your information is discussed below.
      </p>
      <h5>
        Communications from you to us.
      </h5>
      <p>
        We collect information about you when you send, receive, or engage with messages from us, including when you
        submit
        personal information or requests by emailing help&#64;youversion.com or through the website help.youversion.com.
        We
        retain
        and use those communications to process your inquiries, respond to your requests, and improve YouVersion and our
        services. If you are a Member, we will keep your communications to us in association with your account for as
        long as
        your Membership is active.

        If you

      <p>Importantly, we do NOT use cookies or similar technologies to facilitate interest-based ads for third-party
        goods or
        services.
      </p>

      <p>We use cookies to recognize you and/or your device(s) on, off, and across the different applications of
        YouVersion. Cookies help to facilitate the best possible user experience of YouVersion as they allow us to
        recognize you and maintain your user preferences from session to session, help us keep your account safe, and
        generally improve the functionality of the products and services offered through YouVersion. They also help us
        ensure that Member information is used in association with the correct Member account.</p>

      <p>
        We use cookies to collect details of your use of YouVersion (including traffic data, IP location data, logs,
        browser
        type, browser language, the functionality requested, and the timing of your requests), and other communication
        data and
        the resources that you access, use, and create on or through YouVersion. We use this information to provide a
        tailored
        YouVersion experience for you and to communicate with you more effectively. The information is also collected to
        determine the aggregate number of unique devices using YouVersion and/or parts of YouVersion, track total usage,
        analyze
        usage data, and improve YouVersion functionality for all Users. We may combine this information to provide you
        with a
        better experience and to improve the quality of our service.
      </p>

      <p>
        We generally maintain the data we collect from cookies for 21 days but may save it for a longer period where
        necessary
        such as when required by law or for technical reasons. Although most internet browsers accept cookies by
        default, you
        can control cookies through your browser settings and similar tools or refuse cookies altogether. If you refuse
        to
        accept cookies, you may be unable to access certain parts of YouVersion, you will prohibit us from delivering
        the full
        capability of YouVersion, and you may prevent the use of certain features and services that require these
        technologies.
      </p>

      <p>
        YouVersion cannot regulate other sites, content, or applications linked or provided from within YouVersion or
        our
        various other websites and services that are provided by third parties, including your device manufacturer, and
        your
        mobile service provider. These third parties may place their own cookies or other files on your computer,
        collect data,
        or solicit personal information from you. The information they collect may be associated with your personal
        information
        or they may collect information, including personal information, about your online activities over time and
        across
        different websites, apps, and other online services. These third parties may use this information to provide you
        with
        interest-based (behavioral) targeted content. We do not control these third parties' tracking technologies or
        how they
        may be used. If you have any questions about targeted content, you should contact the responsible provider
        directly.
      </p>

      <h5>Attribution providers.</h5>
      <p>We advertise YouVersion on third party sites such as Facebook and Google and use third-party software
        development kits
        (“SDKs”) to attribute a download of YouVersion to the advertisement placed on the third-party site. We do not
        sell your
        personal information to any third parties nor allow our SDK service providers to sell your personal information
        to third
        parties or use your personal information to solicit the sale of third-party goods or services. We may provide
        these
        third parties with aggregate, de-identified information concerning ads placed on their sites and YouVersion
        downloads
        that result from those ads.</p>

      <h5>Device ID, IP address and network access.</h5>
      <p>When you access or leave YouVersion websites, we receive the URL of both the site you came from and the one you
        go to
        next. We also get information about your proxy server, operating system, web browser and add-ons, device
        identifier and
        features, and/or your ISP or mobile carrier when you use YouVersion. We also receive data from your devices and
        networks, including your IP address.</p>

      <p>We use the IP addresses we collect from our users to process them with public latitude and longitude
        information related
        to your Internet Service Provider or mobile service provider in order to determine, and in some instances depict
        in an
        aggregate and de-identified manner, the approximate geographic region for each instance of YouVersion use. This
        latitude
        and longitude information is stored by us for approximately seven days for troubleshooting and diagnostic
        purposes, but
        is never associated with any information about you or that would identify you personally.</p>

      <p>
        We also collect and use the wireless (or “WiFi”) permissions of your mobile device to determine if you are
        connected to
        a WiFi or cellular network. This information is used to provide an optimized user experience by providing higher
        resolution media to a user who is on a high-speed WiFi connection rather than a cellular network. WiFi
        permissions are
        also used for casting content with Chromecast and similar devices. This information is not stored or shared by
        YouVersion.

        <h2>
          How We Use Your Information
        </h2>
      </header>
      <p>We use data that we collect about you and that you provide as well as the inferences we make from that
        information as
        follows:
      </p>
      To provide, support, and personalize YouVersion and the YouVersion functionality you request;
      To create, maintain, customize, and secure your YouVersion account, if any;
      To process your requests and respond to your inquiries;
      To provide information on other products or services;
      To maintain the safety, security, and integrity of YouVersion and the infrastructure that facilitates use of
      YouVersion;
      For development and internal analysis;
      To fulfill any other purpose for which you provide it;
      To carry out our obligations and enforce our rights, including those under this Privacy Policy and our Terms of
      Use;
      As described in this Privacy Policy;
      In any other way we may describe when you provide the information; and
      For any other purpose with your consent.
      <h5>Analytics and performance.
      </h5>
      <p>We internally analyze the personal data available to us and the use of YouVersion content, as well as the
        inferences we
        make from that data, to provide and update YouVersion, communicate with you and process information as discussed
        in this
        Policy, and for internal analytics such as to observe social, economic, and geographic trends as they pertain to
        YouVersion content. In some cases, we work with trusted third parties to perform this research, under controls
        that are
        designed to protect your privacy, as discussed below. We may disclose use of YouVersion content in an aggregated
        manner
        with de-identified and anonymized information that does not disclose any particular user or that user’s
        personally-identifying information. For example, we may use your data to generate statistics about overall usage
        of
        YouVersion worldwide or in specific geographic regions or at specific events or locations.</p>
      <p>We also use de-identified and aggregate user data to market YouVersion, including communications that promote
        YouVersion
        Membership and network growth, such as celebrating the total number of YouVersion installs. When you see stats
        we share
        publicly such as global YouVersion engagement, we make sure to analyze and publish the data in an aggregated
        form,
        protecting your privacy and keeping your identity and personal information confidential. We use data, including
        user
        provided personal information, aggregations of user data, data collected through the use of YouVersion, public
        feedback,
        and information inferred from this data to conduct internal research and development in order to provide a
        better
        overall YouVersion experience, measure the performance of YouVersion, and increase the use of YouVersion and its
        features. This is done by making changes to YouVersion that are generally available, as well as sending users
        messages
        through YouVersion suggesting YouVersion functionality and content.</p>
      <h5>Sensitive Data</h5>
      <p>By downloading and using YouVersion, we do not assume that you are of any particular religious affiliation or
        are
        expressing to us any particular religious belief; we merely assume that you are interested in the content we
        provide. We
        do not require that users provide information about such beliefs or provide any other sensitive data such as
        race,
        ethnicity, philosophical beliefs, or physical or mental health to use YouVersion or create or maintain a
        YouVersion
        Member account.</p>
      <p>
        Some features available through YouVersion utilize personal information that may reflect your religious or
        philosophical
        beliefs. Before we collect or process this information for such features, we will obtain your explicit consent.
        In
        addition to these features, you have control over the content of certain things you create, share, and store
        through
        YouVersion, and if you provide us with sensitive information with any content you create, share, and store, we
        will
        assume we have your consent to process that information.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will not sell your sensitive personal information, but we may need to share it with third-party service
        providers
        that enable us to provide certain app features, and those service providers are required to keep your personal
        information confidential and only use it to provide us with their services. We will process the sensitive
        information we
        collect and inferences we make about the same in accordance with our Privacy Policy and for the purpose of
        allowing and
        facilitating your use of those specific app features, to personalize your user experience, to suggest other
        content and
        services, and internally to improve our services. If you choose to provide any sensitive information to us, we
        may use
        that information with other non-sensitive information you provide to create a more personalized YouVersion
        experience
        for you and to perform the services and actions you request, such as sharing or storing content you create. In
        any
        event, YouVersion will only process sensitive data you provide to us for YouVersion’s legitimate activities on
        your
        behalf and solely in accordance with the terms of this policy and any additional requests you make about the
        information. We will also maintain your information subject to appropriate safeguards discussed in this policy
        and
        otherwise provided by YouVersion.
      </p>
      <p>
        You have the right to withdraw your consent to our collection and processing of your sensitive personal
        information by
        turning off and ceasing to use YouVersion features that use this information or by contacting us via mail at
        YouVersion,
        Attn.: YouVersion Support, 4600 E. 2nd St., Edmond, Oklahoma 73034, or by email at help&#64;youversion.com;
        however,
        withdrawing your consent may hinder our ability to provide certain functionality.

          Disclosure of Your Information
        </h2>
      </header>
      <p>We do not sell or share your personal data with any third-party advertisers or ad networks for their
        advertising
        purposes. We may disclose your personal information to third parties in order to process information as
        described above
        and otherwise enable our ability to provide YouVersion, as further discussed below.</p>
      <h5>Disclosure on your behalf.</h5>
      <p>We may disclose personal information that we collect or you provide as described in this Privacy Policy to
        fulfill our
        obligations under our Terms of Use, to accomplish the purpose for which you provide it, for any other purpose
        you
        request when you provide the information, or for any other purpose for which we have your consent.</p>
      <h5>
        Disclosure by you.
      </h5>
      <p>When you share information through YouVersion, that information is viewable by you and by anyone else you
        choose to
        share it with. If you give access to your YouVersion account to other applications and services, based on your
        approval,
        those services would then have access to your shared information. The use, collection, and protection of your
        data by
        such third-party services is subject to those third parties’ policies.</p>
      <h5>Internal disclosure.</h5>
      <p>We will process your personal data internally within YouVersion and its affiliates to help combine the personal
        information covered across the different aspects of YouVersion and our other products and services to help
        provide
        services to you in a manner that is personalized and useful to you and others.</p>
      <h5>Service providers and locations.</h5>
      <p>We may disclose personal information that we collect or you provide as described in this Privacy Policy to
        contractors,
        service providers, and other third parties we use to support YouVersion (such as cloud hosting, cookie
        providers,
        maintenance, analysis, audit, external marketing, payment, fraud detection, and development), as well as to
        support our
        operations (such as communicating with you for potential employment purposes). We may combine information we
        have with
        information of these service providers to facilitate their support. For example, some of the platforms used to
        send
        emails and notifications provided through YouVersion are built and managed by third parties, so some of your
        information
        is sent securely to those services to provide such functionality. They will have access to your information only
        as
        reasonably necessary to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for other
        purposes. We may also provide aggregate, de-identified information concerning connections by YouVersion users
        with
        third-parties and their events or locations.</p>
      <h5>YouVersion content providers.</h5>
      <p>We utilize certain third parties to provide certain YouVersion content, such as Bible Plans. We do not share
        personal
        information of YouVersion users with these third parties. We do, however, provide these third parties with
        aggregate
        analytics concerning the use of their content by country using de-identified and anonymized data.</p>
      <p>Our ability to provide different versions of the Bible in different languages is a result of and subject to
        agreements
        among us and certain Bible societies and publishers, which we’ll call “YouVersion Bible Providers.” The license
        agreements we have with some YouVersion Bible Providers only allow us to provide YouVersion users the ability to
        download certain Bible texts for offline use if we provide YouVersion Bible Providers with the User’s name,
        email
        address, and country for future communication. If this is the case with a text you are seeking to download for
        offline
        use, we will (i) only share this information with the YouVersion Bible Provider for the offline version you
        request;
        (ii) do so on a confidential basis and only if the YouVersion Bible Provider agrees to keep the information we
        share
        about you confidential; and (iii) provide an additional prompt to you as a reminder of these terms, which you
        must agree
        to at that time in order to continue with your download. If you do not agree to this additional prompt, you may
        continue
        to use the online version of the text. No other personal information of yours will be shared with any YouVersion
        Bible
        Providers and no information will be shared until you grant approval to our prompt, which will then give you
        access to
        download that offline version. Your interactions with any YouVersion Bible Provider are solely among you and
        that
        YouVersion Bible Provider.</p>
      <h5>Legal process.</h5>
      <p>It is possible that we will need to disclose information about you when required by law, subpoena, or other
        legal
        process. We attempt to notify Users about legal demands for their personal data when appropriate in our
        judgment, unless
        prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. We may dispute such demands when we
        believe, in
        our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague, or lack proper authority, but we do not promise to
        challenge
        every demand. We may also disclose your information if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably
        necessary to (i) investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to
        assist
        government enforcement agencies; (ii) enforce our agreements with you; (iii) investigate and defend ourselves
        against
        any third-party claims or allegations; (iv) protect the security or integrity of YouVersion; or (v) exercise or
        protect
        the rights and safety of YouVersion, Users, our personnel, or others. We also reserve the right to
        confidentially
        disclose personal information we have about you in connection with a potential or actual merger or acquisition
        such as
        the sale of all or substantially all of our assets.

        help&#64;youversion.com or via mail to YouVersion, attn.: YouVersion Support, 4600 E. 2nd St., Edmond, Oklahoma
        73034.
      </p>
      <p>We ask that individuals making requests identify themselves with at least their name, address, and email
        address and
        identify the information requested to be accessed, corrected, or removed before we process the request. We may
        seek
        additional information to verify a requestor’s identity. We may also decline to process requests if we cannot
        verify the
        requestor's identity or if we believe the request will jeopardize the privacy of others, violate any law or
        legal
        requirement, would cause the information to be incorrect, or for a similar legitimate purpose.</p>
      <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your rights under applicable law. We do not charge a
        fee to
        process or respond to your verifiable request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we
        determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a
        cost
        estimate before completing your request.</p>
      <p>Some information you have created, received, or used in YouVersion may not be available in a usable form
        outside of
        YouVersion. As a result, when you request a copy of your personal information, we will be able to provide
        personal
        information you have provided to us, such as your name, address, phone number and the like; however, we may be
        unable to
        provide you with content and User Contributions that utilize YouVersion functionality.</p>
      <h5>Deleting your account.</h5>
      <p>
        You can delete your YouVersion account at any time using the settings function in YouVersion; however, when you
        delete
        your account we will delete the information associated with your account such as Notes, Bookmarks and other User
        Contributions you have created, received or shared. If you do not want to delete your account or this
        information, but
        want to temporarily stop using YouVersion, you may cease using the YouVersion application and we will maintain
        your
        account and the information associated with your account until you resume use or delete your account, whichever
        comes
        first.
      </p>
      <p>If you choose to delete your account or ask that we modify or delete personal information, we will delete and
        purge
        personal information we have stored about you in a way that is electronically irreversible, however, we may
        retain your
        personal data if we have a legal right or obligation to maintain the information or to meet regulatory
        requirements,
        resolve disputes, maintain security, prevent fraud and abuse, enforce our rights, or fulfill any other requests
        from you
        (for example, to opt-out of further messages or for a copy of your data). Otherwise, if you request that we
        delete your
        account, we will delete your account and all the information we have that is associated with your account,
        except for
        aggregated statistics based on de-identified information and inferences we have made (for example, the fact that
        you
        downloaded YouVersion, without identifying you or maintaining personal information associated with that
        account).</p>
      <p>
        Our deletion of your information and account will generally take no more than fourteen days from your request;
        however,
        cached information may take up to thirty days to delete. Please note that we have no control of information you
        have
        shared with others through YouVersion after you close your account or asked to delete information or attempted
        to delete
        your account yourself. Your information and content you have shared may continue to be displayed in the services
        of
        others (for example, search engine results) until they refresh their cache.
